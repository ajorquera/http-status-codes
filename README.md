# node-http-codes

## Description
Map of HTTP status messages to codes based on [Node's built-in map](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_status_codes) in reverse.

## Installation
Using npm:

    $ npm install http-codes

## Why use this over others like it

- It's ultra simple, doesn't get simpler than this
- It's based on [Node's built-in map](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_status_codes) in reverse meaning it will auto-update if the built-in does.
- It doesn't depend on other libraries and is not coded on CoffeeScript
 
## The actual map

You can see the generated map by running:

    $ npm test

As of right now (Node 0.10.22) this is the resulting map:
